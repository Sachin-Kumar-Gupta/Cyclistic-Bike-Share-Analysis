# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This project is part of a full portfolio analysis based on a case study by Google. The goal is to analyze historical bike trip data to help **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company, design a marketing strategy that converts **casual riders into annual members**.

---

## 🧠 Business Task

Cyclistic's marketing team wants to understand how different types of riders (casual vs. members) use the service and how to encourage casual users to become paying annual members.

### Key Business Questions:

1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. **Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**
3. **How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**
